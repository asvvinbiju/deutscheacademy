      <h3>Why Choose Us?</h3>
      <p class="p mt-4">
        Because of thomas, our brilliant deutsch teacher. he has completed
        german A1 with good grades and he thinks that makes him that bitch
        hitler, he really said " Ich werde Deutschland zum Ruhm f√ºhren " well
        it's all about confidence baby.
      </p>
      <p class="p mt-2">
        Learning german can be frustrating when you are learning by youself,
        that's where 'WE' come in. Call your teacher thomas and ask your doubts so
        he can shrug his shoulders to make you feel more frustrated.

      <h3>Not Free. Fun. Not Effective</h3>
      <p class="p mt-4">
        Learning german with us is Fun but not free, it's like the joker said
        "if you are good at something never do it for free" not that we need
        money. What makes us unique from others is that when learning german
        from other platform you first learn A1 then A2 follows B1 and B2. But
        here you learn B2 then A3 follows A1, B4, and K9.

      <h3>Expensive Education Gives You An Expensive Life.</h3>
      <p class="p mt-4">
        Our specialty is quality, not assurance. So learning is up to you and
        "Don't blame us if you can't learn german from us Bitch!" says thomas
        after the end of the course. Our course might seems expensive for you
        but its good, says thomas.

      <h3>Know Our Teacher</h3>
      <p class="p mt-4">
        I Would like to present you our most brilliant, brilliant equal to
        Albert Einsteem Not Einstein note that, Thomas Powell. I do not have a
        picture of him because he is a shy bitch. He born in small town called
        Alappuzha and lucky to be cousin of Aswin Biju. That's all about him now
        he has a special request to you yes you reading this " If you are
        reading this and you are studying german to go to germany please send me
        a visa and take me from this hell on earth " says thomas.
      </p>
      <h3 class="h3 mt-5 mb-5">Thank you</h3>
